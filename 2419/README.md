<h2 style="color:#F90;">2419. Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND</h2>

You are given an integer array nums of size n.
Consider a **non-empty** subarray from nums that has the maximum possible **bitwise AND**.

* In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered.

Return the length of the **longest** such subarray.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
**Output**: 2

**Explanation**:
<p style="color:#007;">
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 3.<br>
The longest subarray with that value is [3,3], so we return 2.

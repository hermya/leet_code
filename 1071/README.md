<h2 style="color:#0C9;">1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</h2>

For two strings `s` and `t`, we say "`t` divides `s`" if and only if `s = t + t + t + ... + t + t` (i.e., `t` is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return *the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`*.

**EXAMPLE**
> **Input**: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
**Output**: "ABC"

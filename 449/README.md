### 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST

## Description
Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

## Question
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

**EXAMPLE**
> *Input*: root = [2,1,3]
> *Output*: [2,1,3]

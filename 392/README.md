<h2 style="color:#0C9;">392. Is Subsequence</h2>

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return **true** if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or **false** otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output**: true

<h2 style="color:#F90;">437. Path Sum III</h2>

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return *the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals* `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

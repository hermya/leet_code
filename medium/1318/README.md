<h2 style="color:#F90;">1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c</h2>

Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make ( `a` OR `b` == `c` ). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operation consists of change **any** single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

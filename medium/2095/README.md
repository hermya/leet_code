<h2 style="color:#F90;">2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List</h2>

You are given the `head` of a linked list. **Delete** the **middle node**, and return *the* `head` *of the modified linked list*.

The **middle node** of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋`th node from the **start** using **0-based indexing**, where `⌊x⌋` denotes the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.

* For `n` = `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`, the middle nodes are `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, and `2`, respectively.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
**Output**: [1,3,4,1,2,6]

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
he above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.<br>
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.<br>
We return the new list after removing this node. <br>

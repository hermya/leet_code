<h2 style="color:#F90;">129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers</h2>

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

-   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**EXAMPLE**

>**Input**: root = [1,2,3]
**Output**: 25

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.<br>
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.<br>
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.<br>

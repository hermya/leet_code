<h2 style="color:#F90;">189. Rotate Array</h2>

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Follow up:**
* Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
* Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
**Output**: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]<br>
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]<br>
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
</p>

<h2 style="color:#F90;">1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs</h2>

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return *the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array*.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
**Output**: 1

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]<br>
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]<br>
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

<h2 style="color:#F90;">1143. Longest Common Subsequence</h2>

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return *the length of their **longest common** subsequence*. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
**Output**: 3

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

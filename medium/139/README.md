<h2 style="color:#F90;">139. Word Break</h2>

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**EXAMPLE 1**
>**Input**: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
**Output**: false

**EXAMPLE 1**
>**Input**: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
**Output**: true

<p style="color:#007;">

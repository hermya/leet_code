<h2 style="color:#F90;">167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted</h2>

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in **non-decreasing order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index`~1~`]` and `numbers[index`~2~`]` where `1 <= index`~1~` < index`~2~` <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index`~1~ and `index`~2~, **added by one** as an integer array `[index`~1~`, index`~2~`]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output**: [1,2]

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

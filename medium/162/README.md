<h2 style="color:#F90;">162. Find Peak Element</h2>

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
**Output**: 5

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

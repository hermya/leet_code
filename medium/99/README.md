<h2 style="color:#F90;">99. Recover Binary Search Tree</h2>

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.

**EXAMPLE**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg)
>**Input**: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
**Output**: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.

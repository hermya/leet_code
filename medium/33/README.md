<h2 style="color:#F90;">33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array</h2>

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
**Output**: 4

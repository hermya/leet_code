<h2 style="color:#F90;">909. Snakes and Ladders</h2>

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `board` where the cells are labeled from `1` to `n2` in a [**Boustrophedon style**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. `board[n - 1][0]`) and alternating direction each row.

You start on square `1` of the board. In each move, starting from square `curr`, do the following:

-   Choose a destination square `next` with a label in the range `[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)]`.
    -   This choice simulates the result of a standard **6-sided die roll**: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
-   If `next` has a snake or ladder, you **must** move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `next`.
-   The game ends when you reach the square `n2`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and `n2` do not have a snake or ladder.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do **not** follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

-   For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do **not** follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.

Return _the least number of moves required to reach the square_ `n2`_. If it is not possible to reach the square, return_ `-1`.

**EXAMPLE**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/09/23/snakes.png)
>**Input**: board = \[[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
**Output**: 4

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).<br>
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.<br>
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.<br>
You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.<br>
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.<br>
This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.

<h2 style="color:#F90;">1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor</h2>

Given the root of a binary tree, **find the maximum value v** for which 
> there exist different nodes a and b where 
    `v = |a.val - b.val|` 
    and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.

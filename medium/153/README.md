<h2 style="color:#F90;">153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array</h2>

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

-   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
-   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs inÂ `O(log n) time.`

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
**Output**: 0

<b>Explanation</b><br>
The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times

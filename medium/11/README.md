You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`^th^ line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

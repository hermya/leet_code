<h2 style="color:#F90;">207. Course Schedule</h2>

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

-   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**EXAMPLE 1**
>**Input**: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[[1,0]]
**Output**: true

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>

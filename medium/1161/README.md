<h2 style="color:#F90;">1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree</h2>

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of its children is `2`, and so on.

Return the **smallest** level `x` such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level `x` is **maximal**.



**EXAMPLE**

>**Input**: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
**Output**: 2
<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
Level 1 sum = 1.<br>
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.<br>
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.<br>
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

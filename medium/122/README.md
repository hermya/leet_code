<h2 style="color:#F90;">122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II</h2>

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output**: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br>
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.<br>
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

<h2 style="color:#F00;">124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum</h2>

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**EXAMPLE**

>**Input**: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output**: 42

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

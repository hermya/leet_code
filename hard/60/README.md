<h2 style="color:#F00;">60. Permutation Sequence</h2>

The set `[1, 2, 3, ...,Â n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

1.  `"123"`
2.  `"132"`
3.  `"213"`
4.  `"231"`
5.  `"312"`
6.  `"321"`

Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.

**EXAMPLE**
>Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"

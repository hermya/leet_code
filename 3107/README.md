<h2 style="color:#F90;">3107. Minimum Operations to Make Median of Array Equal to K</h2>

You are given an integer array `nums` and a **non-negative** integer `k`. In one operation, you can increase or decrease any element by 1.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to make the **median** of `nums` *equal to* `k`.

The median of an array is defined as the middle element of the array when it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If there are two choices for a median, the larger of the two values is taken.


**EXAMPLE**
> **Input**: nums = [2,5,6,8,5], k = 4
**Output**: 2

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>EXPLANATION</b><br>
We can subtract one from nums[1] and nums[4] to obtain [2, 4, 6, 8, 4]. The median of the resulting array is equal to k.

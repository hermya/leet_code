<h2 style="color:#0C9;">605. Can Place Flowers</h2>

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *new flowers can be planted in the* `flowerbed` *without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and* `false` *otherwise*.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
**Output**: false

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
You can place only one flower on this flowerbed at position 3, placing any other flower will violate the policy.

<h2 style="color:#0C9;">3131. Find the Integer Added to Array I</h2>

You are given two arrays of equal length, `nums1` and `nums2`.

Each element in `nums1` has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable `x`.

As a result, `nums1` becomes **equal** to `nums2`. Two arrays are considered **equal** when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.

Return the integer `x`.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums1 = [2,6,4], nums2 = [9,7,5]
**Output**: 3

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
The integer added to each element of nums1 is 3.

<h2 style="color:#0C9;">205. Isomorphic Strings</h2>

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: s = "egg", t = "add"
**Output**: true

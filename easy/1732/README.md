<h2 style="color:#0C9;">1732. Find the Highest Altitude</h2>

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the **net gain in altitude** between points `i`​​​​​​ and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n`). Return the **highest altitude** of a point.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
**Output**: 1

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.

<h2 style="color:#0C9;">3127. Make a Square with the Same Color</h2>

You are given a 2D matrix grid of size `3 x 3` consisting only of characters `'B'` and `'W'`. Character `'W'` represents the white color, and character `'B'` represents the black color.

Your task is to change the color of at most one cell so that the matrix has a `2 x 2` square where all cells are of the same color.

Return `true` if it is possible to create a `2 x 2` square of the same color, otherwise, return `false`.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: grid = \[["B","W","B"],["B","W","W"],["B","W","B"]]
**Output**: true

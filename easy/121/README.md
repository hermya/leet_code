<h2 style="color:#0C9;">121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</h2>

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`^th^ day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output**: 5

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.<br>
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

<h2 style="color:#0C9;">2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer</h2>

Given an array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return _the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers._

-   In other words, if the number of positive integers in `nums` is `pos` and the number of negative integers is `neg`, then return the maximum of `pos` and `neg`.

**Note** that `0` is neither positive nor negative.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2]
>**Output**: 3

<p style="color:#007;">

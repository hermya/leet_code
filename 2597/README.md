<h2 style="color:#F90;">2597. The Number of Beautiful Subsets</h2>

You are given an array `nums` of **positive** integers and a positive integer `k`.

A subset of `nums` is **beautiful** if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to `k`.

Return the number of **non-empty beautiful** subsets of the array `nums`.

A **subset** of `nums` is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

**EXAMPLE**
>**Input**: nums = [2,4,6], k = 2
**Output**: 4

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>Explanation</b><br>
The beautiful subsets of the array nums are: [2], [4], [6], [2, 6].<br>
It can be proved that there are only 4 beautiful subsets in the array [2,4,6].

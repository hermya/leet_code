<h2 style="color:#0C9;">3105. Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray</h2>

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Return the length of the ***longest** [subarray](## "A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.") of `nums` which is either **[strictly increasing](## "An array is said to be strictly increasing if each element is strictly greater than its previous one (if exists).")** or **[strictly decreasing](## "An array is said to be strictly decreasing if each element is strictly smaller than its previous one (if exists).")***.

**EXAMPLE**
> **Input**: nums = [1,4,3,3,2]
**Output**: 2

<p style="color:#007;">
<b>EXPLANATION</b><br>
The strictly increasing subarrays of nums are [1], [2], [3], [3], [4], and [1,4].<br>
The strictly decreasing subarrays of nums are [1], [2], [3], [3], [4], [3,2], and [4,3].<br>
Hence, we return 2.<br>
